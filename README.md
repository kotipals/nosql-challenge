# nosql-challenge

In this challenge we're asked to look at a NoSQL database called uk_food and the collection of establishments (restaurants) it contains. We then conduct analysis about the establishments to help the food magazine, Eat Safe, Love, journalists and food critics to figure out which establishments they should focus their future articles on.
